## Contributing

Thank you for taking your time and contributing to this project. Any kind of suggestion/contribution is welcomed.

It is best if you could follow these sets of guidelines when contributing to this repository.


### Asking questions

For now, our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Lee-matod/dev/issues) is the best place where you can ask questions
regarding this extension. In the future I may make a public Discord server, but for now we'll just stick to GitHub.


### Bug reports

- Make sure to share clear and useful information. We may ask you to elaborate or give us more information. In case you 
do not respond within a week, your issue will be closed. 
- Try your best not to open duplicate issues. Take some time to search if someone else has had the same problem as you.
- When including tracebacks/exceptions, make sure to include the **entire** traceback, otherwise it will be hard for us 
to solve your problem.


### Pull requests

- Keep your pull requests focused on a single aspect such that you can summarize it in less than 50 characters.  
- This project is strictly typed, and follows PEP-8 guidelines. While type checking may not be so fun, at least keep the 
style consistent with that of this project.
- Use present tense ("Add feature", not "Added feature").
- When referring to other issues or pull requests, use the shorthand `#123` instead of the URL.
